# ALS Alert System 
ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a condition which results in loss of voluntary control
of muscles and, in later stages, an inability to speak. The goal of this project is to develop 
a low-cost eye-triggered alert system for persons with ALS to communicate a need for assistance
when their caregivers are not nearby

## Overview 
The ALS Alert system works by using Electrooculography (EOG) data. EOG is a method to measure
the eletrical current generated by a patient moving their eyes from side to side. If a patient moves their eyes from side to side rapidly over a short time, they will trigger an alert. This alert will trip an alarm attached to the microprocessor and send a notification to the caregiver's phone. Each  trigger is stored in Firebase, which handles authentication, storage, and app hosting. They are connected by WiFI. A diagram of the device communication is shown here: ![diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8ad1a2a-f22d-4b5c-b0c0-97c74472b163)

Tech Stack- 
Backend- Firebase


## Installation

This repo contains two pieces of code that operate together. The bulk of the
repository contains the code for the phone app. This is written in Kotlin and Java.
In addition, we have provided the EOG code, written in Arduino C, that detects when
an alert has been triggered. **In order for the app to operate, you must install BOTH **

##Standards
Since we are creating a medical device, there are several important codes and
 standards that we need to be aware of to support the safety and well-being
of those we are trying to assist. ISO 60601 requirements govern commercial
medical devices. Although we are not intending to commercialize our final device,
this standard can aid us in initially designing our device in a way that could streamline
future commercialization.
